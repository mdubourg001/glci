# glci ü¶ä

Ease GitLab CI Pipelines set-up by running your jobs locally in Docker containers.

Why ? Because I did not want to commit, push, and wait for my jobs to run on the GitLab UI to figure I forgot to install `make` before running `make build`.

üì£ Disclaimer: this is a helper tool aiming to facilite the process of setting up GitLab CI Pipelines. glci **does NOT** aim to replace any other tool.

## Installation

You need to have Docker installed and running to use glci.

```bash
yarn global add glci
```

## Usage

At the root of your project (where your `.gitlab-ci.yml` is):

```bash
glci
```

‚ö†Ô∏è You might want to add `.glci` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing it.

## Options

### `--only-jobs [jobs]`

Limiting the jobs to run to the comma-separated list of jobs name given. Handy when setting up that stage-three job depending on that first-stage job artifacts.

Example:

```bash
glci --only-jobs=install,test:e2e

# "build" and "test:unit" won't be ran here
#
# -----------     ---------     -------------
# | install | --- | build | --- | test:unit |
# -----------     ---------  |  -------------
#                            |
#                            |   ------------
#                            --- | test:e2e |
#                                ------------
```

### `--yml <yml_file_path>`

Setting the file to use in place of `.gitlab-ci.yml` (default to `.gitlab-ci.yml`). Useful when testing parent-child pipelines.

### `--dir <directory_name>`

Changing the directory where glci keeps cache and artifacts between jobs. Defaults to `.glci`.

### `--clean`

Removing the directory given to `--dir` (default to `.glci`) before running glci.

### `--no-draw`

Not drawing the representation of the pipeline before running jobs.

## Cool stuff

- If a `.env` file exists next to your `.gitlab-ci.yml`, variables inside it get automatically parsed and added to the containers
- Most of the pre-defined environment variables normally set by GitLab CI are also set here: see [pre-defined.js](/pre-defined.js)

## Pulling images from private registries / repositories

To be able to pull images from private registries / repositories, glci copies a GitLab CI mechanism: the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` env variable (see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_images.html#configuring-a-job).

As glci automatically reads the `.env` file at the root of your project, you can set a `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` inside it as you would do it in GitLab CI/CD variables configurations and you should be able to pull images from your private registries.

Don't forget to add this `.env` file to your `.gitignore`.

## Use glci itself inside a Docker container

At the root of the project you want ro run glci for:

```bash
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/app -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock glci
```

This creates a container with the last version of glci running. The two volumes are needed to bind your project files inside the container, and to be able to use Docker from inside the container.

## How does it work ?

It's pretty straightforward:

- it parses your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file (and its "includes")
- it runs each job of each stage (serially) in a Docker container created on the fly using the right image
- it logs the results in the console
- it shares the `cache` and the `artifacts` between jobs using Docker volumes
- it automatically stops and removes the containers and the volumes created

## Roadmap

- Handle glob in `cache:paths` and `artifacts:paths`
- Handle `artifacts:exclude` (supports globs too)
- Add `--env` to allow defining / overriding env variables
- Add `--in-vagrant` to run docker in Vagrant (not faster even on Mac for what I've tried)
- Prevent sharing artifacts between same-stage jobs
